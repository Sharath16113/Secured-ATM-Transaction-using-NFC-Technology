# Secured-ATM-Transaction-using-NFC-Technology
Near Field Communication (NFC) Technology represents short range (practically up to 4 cm) wireless communication offering safe yet simple and intuitive communication between electronic devices that we use on a daily basis. Users of devices with NFC applications can touch their devices to other similar elements having NFC applications to communicate with them, making application and data usage easy and convenient. NFC can be called the next generation of Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) as technically its working principle is based on RFID however from an application point of view it is similar to Bluetooth in some ways since it allows communication between two active devices. NFC can be the future medium of contactless electronic payment as it inhibits eavesdropping on NFC - enabled transactions pertaining to its short range, however, the range can be extended by attackers using some range extension system. In this paper, we briefly discussed the advantages, limits, or challenges of NFC technology and its applications which opens up exciting new usage scenarios for mobile devices.

This application has to be developed in java technology
➢ This system must have two types of web application.
1. Admin
2. Sales Person
➢ Admin must have access to web-based application and android application.
➢ User/Sales Person can able to login into their android application with authenticated user id and password. Before login user has to register. If the userid and password is validated then only he can login.
➢ The Sales person can add any customer can able to add products into shopping cart, total amount is calculated, then there is option for paying by cash and pay by card. If paying by card option, salesperson has to use Android application.
Web Server Applications
The Web Server application is running on web server where the centralized database is stored. There is separate Admin session available through which admin can able to maintain the Salesperson details and Product details. There is another login for Salesperson where he adds the product through the web application. Once it is added, the total amount is calculated and if paying by card the android application is used. There is also one more login for bank details, where you add the card details you can use later for android application.
Android Application
The Android application is used for NFC writing, NFC reading and card payment by receiving the OTP through mail and validating the customer card credentials.

In our future work, the plan is to focus on the security aspects of the custom authentication app to be installed on the smartphone. Also, an exhaustive analysis will be carried out on the possible security attacks during ATM transactions which have not been addressed in the scope of this paper.
• People must get the power to select what part of selected piece of information they want to share and hide what they don’t like a person may want to convey some part of their health records to the doctor while some other with a health insurance agent.
• A list of mobile phone having NFC can be obtained from http://www.nfcworld.com/nfcphones-list/ and many more models are on their way to be launched soon.
• Soon, even the locking system will be replaced by personalized NFC enabled devices and NFC tags as door locks. Thus NFC will act as a farther step towards the world of automatic devices.
• Even for the basic needs there will be the need for an NFC-enabled device like for subscribing for personalized offers that will be made available to unique smart phone holders.
