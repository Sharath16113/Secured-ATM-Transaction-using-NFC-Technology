# Secured-ATM-Transaction-using-NFC-Technology
Near Field Communication (NFC) Technology represents short range (practically up to 4 cm) wireless communication offering safe yet simple and intuitive communication between electronic devices that we use on a daily basis. Users of devices with NFC applications can touch their devices to other similar elements having NFC applications to communicate with them, making application and data usage easy and convenient. NFC can be called the next generation of Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) as technically its working principle is based on RFID however from an application point of view it is similar to Bluetooth in some ways since it allows communication between two active devices. NFC can be the future medium of contactless electronic payment as it inhibits eavesdropping on NFC - enabled transactions pertaining to its short range, however, the range can be extended by attackers using some range extension system. In this paper, we briefly discussed the advantages, limits, or challenges of NFC technology and its applications which opens up exciting new usage scenarios for mobile devices.
